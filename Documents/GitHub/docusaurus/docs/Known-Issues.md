### [#21](https://github.com/sillsdev/docu-notion/issues/21) {#6ea2708f1107413c91360ea35f658bcf}


Normal paragraph with &lt;breaking syntax&gt;

1. List item 1 is normal
1. List item 2 has &lt;syntax&gt; which causes issues for the html parser (& what about :  / \ [ ] { } ; “ ‘)?!
1. See [https://github.com/sillsdev/docu-notion/issues/21](https://github.com/sillsdev/docu-notion/issues/21)

What about a link with [&lt;angle brackets&gt;](/oranges)?
